# ColorizedTextJavaScriptModule
Just had this idea of calculate a constant color value for a given piece of text

`index.html` contains the sample usage whereas the module is named `colorize.js`.

To run the example locally, one option would be to use `npx serve` (requires [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/)).
